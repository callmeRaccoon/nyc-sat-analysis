 NYC Schools SAT Analysis

This project analyzes SAT performance across New York City schools, identifying top-performing schools and trends in different boroughs.

üìå Project Overview

The dataset contains SAT scores for various schools in NYC. The project includes:
	‚Ä¢	Identifying schools with top math scores.
	‚Ä¢	Finding top 10 schools based on the total SAT score.
	‚Ä¢	Determining the borough with the highest standard deviation in SAT scores.

 üõ† Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Python
	‚Ä¢	Pandas (Data Analysis)

üìä Analysis Performed

1Ô∏è‚É£ Best Math Schools
	‚Ä¢	Selected schools with average math score ‚â• 640 (80% of the maximum score).
	‚Ä¢	Sorted in descending order.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Schools by Total SAT Score
	‚Ä¢	Calculated total SAT as the sum of:
	‚Ä¢	Math
	‚Ä¢	Reading
	‚Ä¢	Writing
	‚Ä¢	Sorted to find top 10 highest-scoring schools.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Borough with Highest Standard Deviation in SAT
	‚Ä¢	Grouped by borough to find:
	‚Ä¢	Number of schools (num_schools)
	‚Ä¢	Mean SAT score (average_SAT)
	‚Ä¢	Standard deviation (std_SAT)
	‚Ä¢	Selected the borough with the highest variability.
